This is my fifth PyGame based (arcady) game project.

Even though I've created an arcady Mario Party minigame 2D demake again (like in my previous projects),
this time I've added a 'What If...'-component to the graphical appearance (see the main.py file's docstring).

The sprites are made in a combination of using Adobe Illustrator (drawings) and Photoshop (eventual pixelazation).

Please consider the main.py's docstring for further information about the actual game.

Arrow Keys and Space/Return are used to navigate through the menus. Ingame controls will be displayed once the characters are chosen.

You can play it via executing the .exe file or with starting the main.py file with your locally installed Python interpreter (vers. 3.10+).

...and something might happen when you enter the so-called Konami-Code at the Welcome Screen. ;)
