This is my fifth PyGame based (arcady) game project.

Even though I've created an arcady Mario Party minigame 2D demake again (like my previous projects),
this time I've added a 'What If...'-component to the graphical appearance (see the main file's docstring).

The sprites are made in a combination of using Adobe Illustrator (drawing) and Photoshop (pixelate).

Please consider the docstring of the main.py file for further information about the actual game.

Arrow Keys and Space/Return are used to navigate through the menus. Ingame controls will be displayed.
